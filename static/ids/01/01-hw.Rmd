# Homework One: Plotting & Intro to R

## Part One: Exploring Your Data

We're going to use a new dataset, `mpg`, included with the `ggplot2` package. To
load the data, we'll start off by loading `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

### Question 1

We can now explore the `mpg` dataset the same way we did for iris. In the code 
chunk below, use the three functions we used to explore `iris` to find out more 
about `mpg`.

```{r}

```

### Question 2

When data comes with a package, it will usually be documented. You can read the 
documentation for a dataset (or a function) by running `?<name>` (just like 
you run any other line of code -- either Ctrl + Enter or type it into the 
console directly). 

Try running ?mpg to get more information on our dataset. What does the drv 
variable describe?

## Part Two: Basic Plotting

### Question 3

Using ggplot2, make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

```{r}

```

### Question 4

What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r}

```

ANSWER: 

### Question 5

Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue? Fix it!

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

### Question 6

Why do these two graphs look the same?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

ANSWER:

## Part Three: Make this graph!

There are a number of datasets included with the ggplot2 package. We'll start 
using the `diamonds` data to make a handful of plots. You should take the chance
to explore it the same way we did iris and mpg!

I made four graphs using this data set, included as make_this_graph numbers 1 - 
4. You should be able to remake all of them, using the techniques we've gone 
over and a tiny bit of Googling. 

Run the code in each of these chunks to see the graph, then use the following 
chunk to recreate it. Note that each graph took me about ten lines of 
code to make -- if you find yourself writing much more than that, you're 
probably going down a rabbit hole somewhere.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mm218.dev/ids/01/make_this_graph_1.png")
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mm218.dev/ids/01/make_this_graph_2.png")
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mm218.dev/ids/01/make_this_graph_3.png")
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mm218.dev/ids/01/make_this_graph_4.png")
```

```{r}
