# Homework Three: Data Wrangling

## Part One: Ungrouped Wrangling

### Question 1

We're going to start working with data frames now! In order to do so, load the 
`dplyr` package with `library` now:

```{r}

```

If the package loaded correctly, you should now have access to the `storms` 
dataset. Use whichever of the methods we've gone over to explore a dataset to 
get familiar with it below:

```{r}

```

### Question 2

How many distinct storm names are in the `storms` table? How many years are 
included?

```{r}

```

ANSWER: ____ names, ____ years

### Question 3

What year had the storm with the highest pressure? What was the storm named?

```{r}

```

ANSWER: 

### Question 4

What day and month combination has the most records? You'll probably want to use
the `count` function here.

```{r}

```

### Question 5

Create a new column for our `storms` dataframe, named ID, which combines the 
year, month, day, and name of each storm into a unique ID. To combine the 
fields, use the `paste` function. What type is the output vector?

```{r}

```

ANSWER:

## Part Two: Grouped Operations

### Question 6

Use our `dplyr` functions to find the storm each year with the highest wind 
speeds. Your code should return a table of storm name and year, which should be
46 rows long.

If you need a hint, the only dplyr functions you should need are `group_by`, 
`filter`, and `distinct`. You'll also need a base R function to find the highest
wind of each year.

```{r}
storms %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(wind == max(wind)) %>% 
  distinct(name, year)
```

### Question 7

Find the average and median wind speed and pressure for each year. You should 
have 41 rows and five columns when you're done!

```{r}

```

### Question 8

Run the code in the chunk below to see the graph, then use the following 
chunk to recreate it. Note that we can pipe straight into `ggplot` from dplyr --
since the first argument to `ggplot` is the data, it works with pipes just like 
all our `dplyr` functions!

This graph took me eight lines of code to make, including getting the counts of 
storms by year and status. Note that you'll also need to load ggplot2 using `library`.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mm218.dev/ids/03/make_this_graph_1.png")
```

```{r}

```
