## Bio

I'm a PhD candidate at SUNY-ESF, working with Colin Beier and Aidan Ackerman on
predictive modeling and visualization with a focus on natural systems. My 
past projects have included assessing the landscape-level impacts of ecosystem 
engineers within New York's Adirondack State Park, as well as investigating the 
impact of fertilization on beech bark disease within the White Mountains of New 
Hampshire. In all of these projects I've worked to apply data science techniques 
to large-scale challenges, frequently serving as the statistical and technical 
expert within my team.

You can find a full list of my publications [at this link](papers), view [my CV](cv.pdf),
or read my [technical blog](blog.html).
