As such,\nwhatever title you give your graph should reflect the point of that\nstory – titles such as “Tree diameter (cm) versus age (days)” and so on\nadd nothing that the user can’t get from the graphic itself. Instead,\nuse your title to advance your message whenever it makes sense –\notherwise, if it doesn’t add any new information, you’re better off\nerasing it altogether.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The important takeaway here is not that explanatory graphics are\nnecessarily more polished than exploratory ones, or that exploratory\ngraphics are only for the analyst – periodic reporting, for instance,\nwill often use highly polished exploratory graphics to identify existing\ntrends, hoping to spur more intensive analysis that will identify the\nwhys. Instead, the message is that knowing the end purpose of your graph\n– whether it should help identify patterns in the first place or explain\nhow they got there – can help you decide what elements need to be\nincluded to tell the story your graphic is designed to address.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"how-do-we-tell-a-story\"\n    }}>{`How do we tell a story?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The other important consideration when thinking about graph design is\nthe actual `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`how`}</em>{` you’ll tell your story, including what design elements\nyou’ll use and what data you’ll display.
