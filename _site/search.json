My current work focuses on using game engines as GIS to visualize large-scale landscapes with a focus on forested systems as a method for scientific communication and outreach. Past projects have focused on landscape and community ecology, and have included predictive models of forest biomass from remote sensing data and the landscape-level impacts of beaver within New York’s Adirondack State Park. In all of these projects I’ve worked to apply data science techniques to large-scale challenges, frequently serving as the statistical and technical expert within my team.\n            On this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my CV, as well as a technical blog.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Education\n            State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry | Syracuse, NY\n            Ph.D. in Environmental Science | August 2020 - Present (Expected 2024)\n            B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Science | August 2015 - December 2018\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Selected Projects\n            \n            Publications\n            unifir: A Unifying API for Interacting with Unity from R.
