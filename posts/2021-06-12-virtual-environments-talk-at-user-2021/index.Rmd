I'm thrilled to be giving a talk (with Colin Beier and Aidan Ackerman) at useR 
2021! We're calling the talk "Virtual Environments: Using R as a Frontend for 3D 
Rendering of Digital Landscapes" -- generally speaking, I'm talking about the 
idea of using R to create visualizations inside game engines, and specifically 
about how we do so using terrainr.

The video should go up on YouTube after the conference, and the slides (and 
a rough script for the talk) are online at 
https://github.com/mikemahoney218/user2021 . My favorite line from the script
is "R is where our users are" -- I didn't quite realize I had any Boston accent
left until I tripped over that sentence a few times.
