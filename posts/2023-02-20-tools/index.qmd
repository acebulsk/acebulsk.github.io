[Greg Wilson posted this](https://third-bit.com/2023/01/24/commands-i-use/) and then [Eugene Wallingford posted this](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2023-02.html#e2023-02-20T10_18_38.htm) and it seemed like fun: what are the most common shell commands I use?

Counting command usage is pretty straightforward:

```bash
$ history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 50
```

And my list winds up looking like this:

```
git # Though of course, this is a bunch of different commands
cd # Did you know you don't need to use cd in zsh? 
# You can just type the directory. I learned this last week, evidently.
sudo
ls
find
quarto # I don't think this includes rendering from RStudio! 
grep
rm
gdalwarp # -multi -co NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE \ 
# -co PREDICTOR=3 -co BIGTIFF=YES
ra # My alias for radian -- https://github.com/randy3k/radian
nano # Possibly from teaching Software Carpentry lessons
cat
docker # I always teach using https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio
rsync
cargo
htop
xkill # No, *you're* cheating at Crusader Kings
pip
ssh
R # Interesting to me that I have three separate R calls here
Rscript
curl
mkdir
labrador # Alias to SSH into another computer
convert # Have done a _lot_ of image processing work for the PhD
tmux # Highly, highly recommend https://github.com/tmux/tmux
qvm # The _only_ way to use Quarto https://github.com/dpastoor/qvm
ping # I break my local network more than I care to admit
gdal_calc.py 
killall # "Whoops, accidentally used all threads for that job again"
echo
co # Alias to SSH into another computer
cp
ogr2ogr # Called a lot, but called _correctly_ very rarely
mv
python # More often called from inside an IDE
ogrinfo
history
which
touch
wc
source
gdalinfo
du # Doing spatial modeling on local compute resources is... rough
sshpi # Alias to SSH into another computer
sed
gdal_translate
ffmpeg # Surprisingly useful for conference talks
wget
scp
```

I'm surprised by how much more I use gdalwarp than the rest of the suite! But
otherwise, this all makes pretty intuitive sense to me.
