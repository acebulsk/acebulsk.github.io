#### Required

    * Make sure you follow the instructions to install R, R Studio, and the

    * Code through it!

#### Optional

* [What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
    * Sections 1 through 5 are great for understanding this class. The rest is 
      great for understanding our world. This is super long -- I want to 
      empahsize that this one is definitely optional, but it's the best article 
      I've ever read about programming.
