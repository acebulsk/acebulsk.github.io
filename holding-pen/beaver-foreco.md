## Stem size selectivity is stronger than species preferences for beaver, a central place forager.

Or so I (along with my co-author and undergraduate research advisor, [John Stella](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/stella/))
claim in [a new paper out in Forest Ecology and Management](). I'm honestly really 
proud of this paper -- it's my first in a peer-reviewed journal, coming out of 
my [undergraduate thesis](../../2019/03/thesis-published.html) which kicked off
all the way back in 2017. We think we've found good evidence that beaver mostly 
harvest whatever trees are large enough to merit dragging back to the pond, but 
small enough to be draggable in the first place, and don't particularly care 
about what species of tree they happen to be bringing back. I'll be interested 
to see if anyone strongly agrees or disagrees with us -- or if we're even noticed 
at all!

The article is free for the time being [at this link](). Below is a hopefully 
slightly more approachable overview of the key points.

## A Little Bit of Background

Almost everyone I talk to already knows that beaver cut down trees to build their
dams (and lodges, too). Fewer people know that beaver will eat trees, too -- 
particularly in winter months when there's not a ton of aquatic plants to eat [1].
This means that beaver harvest trees every year, whether or not they still need 
to construct a dam or lodge; as a result, beaver are continuously altering the
ecosystems they live in through their foraging.

The problem is, we don't fully understand what impact this foraging actually has
on the surrounding landscape. Beaver can wind up removing almost the entire 
forest [2], only leaving behind the few trees that weren't worth the 
energy it'd take to drag back to the pond, but we don't entirely know what the 
forest that's left behind looks like. Since we're starting to actively use 
beaver in environmental restoration projects -- as beaver increase 
biodiversity [3] and improve ecosystem function [4] -- it's 
starting to become important that we understand what impacts they'll have on 
the surrounding forest as their populations increase.

In particular, it's still unclear how exactly beaver choose which trees they'll
harvest. We have good reason to think that beaver will prefer intermediate-sized
trees (think 2-7 centimeters diameter), because those are big enough to have 
enough energy content to be worth felling, but small enough that they can be 
dragged back to the lodge reasonably efficiently [5]. And some researchers have found
that beaver are more likely to prefer forage that's easily digested, probably 
meaning they can get more energy from the same amount of wood [6]. But we don't know
how strong these preferences are, especially relative to one another -- which 
matters, since a strong species preference (meaning beaver are more likely to harvest
a single species, and maybe even eliminate it from the site) would result in a 
very different forest than a strong size preference (which might actually even
out the different species in the forest).

Which is what lead to our study -- we wanted to better understand exactly how 
beaver decide what trees they'll harvest, and what that does to the surrounding 
landscape. So in the summer of 2018 I took to the woods of the Adirondacks and 
did a whole lot of measuring trees.

## So What About It

A few of our findings really aren't shocking. Beaver are definitely harvesting 
stems in the Adirondacks. They do it so much that there's a ton more light 
hitting the ground near their ponds, where they forage the most, than further 
into the woods.

We also found that beaver size preferences are strong -- and as you got further
and further away from the pond, the preference for those intermediate sized 
stems got even stronger.

And we found that, by combining our distance and size measurements, we could 
predict (with pretty good accuracy!) which stems of a given species were at a 
higher risk of being harvested.

Interestingly, though, there was a lot of variation between which species were 
most preferred at any given site, which wouldn't make a ton of sense if species 
were harvested because they were easier to digest than the other options -- 
there's no reason for an American beech further south to be easier to digest than 
the ones further north! That said, we can't rule out the possibility that the 
variation is driven by some sites where a species is the most digestible option 
and others where there are multiple better options available.

To try and look at this further, we looked at some data on stem digestibility, 
collected for a study on moose foraging in the Adirondacks. To our surprise, 
we couldn't find any relationship between digestibility and beaver preferences! 
What we could find, however, was a strong relationship between beaver species 
preference and the proportion of a species inside the desirable intermediate size
range -- which we think suggests that species preferences are just a function 
of what sizes of each species are available for harvest at a given site. If 
supported, this would be a really cool finding -- for one thing, it means that 
beaver impacts are going to be a lot more generalizable than we had thought. I 
think we present good evidence here for it, but I look forward to seeing what 
(if anything) other researchers think of it.

## Why Care

As I mentioned earlier in this post, we're starting to actively encourage beaver
to build new colonies, usually as part of a broader ecological restoration plan. 
But even without our help, beaver are coming back in a big way -- with a huge
drop-off in hunting and trapping, beaver populations are set to skyrocket in the 
near future, with huge numbers of dams and lodges coming your way. And with 
this tidal wave of rodents upon us, it's important for us to understand what 
impact these critters have on the surrounding landscape so that we can adapt our
land management to expect and accomodate their activity. Understanding how and 
why beaver select trees to harvest is an important part of that, and an important
piece of information for us to be equipped with when it comes to understanding 
and managing our natural world.
